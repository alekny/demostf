# plugin

Automatically upload recorded stv demos to [demos.tf](https://demos.tf)
Requires [SteamWorks](https://github.com/KyleSanderson/SteamWorks) (preferred for SM 1.11) or [cURL](https://github.com/spiretf/docker-comp-server/raw/master/curl.ext.so) (for backwards compatibility for SM < 1.10).
Thanks to [F2](https://github.com/F2/F2s-sourcemod-plugins) for [AnyHTTP](https://github.com/F2/F2s-sourcemod-plugins/blob/master/includes/anyhttp.inc)
